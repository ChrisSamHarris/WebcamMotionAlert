Images from a CS perspective:
- Sets of numbers reperesent pixels of an image e.g. [187 41 160]
- BGR (BlueGreenRed) on pixel colour 
- opencv to transform the image into an array (intro.py)
- image.png has a total of 12 pixels
- opencv is built ontop on numpy
- can both analyse and generate an image using OpenCV (image.png vs generated_image.png)
